This method functions identically to the Window.getSelection() method; 
it returns a Selection object representing the text currently selected in the document.

# Document.createRange()
Returns a new Range object.

# Selection.getRangeAt()
The Selection.getRangeAt() method returns a range object representing one of the ranges currently selected.

# Selection.removeAllRanges()
The Selection.removeAllRanges() method removes all ranges from the selection, 
leaving the anchorNode and focusNode properties equal to null and leaving nothing selected.

# insertNode
